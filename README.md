# Destiny Riley's Writing Portfolio

An experienced writer whose versatile expertise includes research, SEO, academic, and fiction writing. I hold both a bachelor of science in sociology and a bachelor of art in creative writing, the latter of which earned departmental distinction. My thesis, Venice Burning, earning the first ever Novel Prize bestowed by Coe College. I am the proud recipient of the Best Freshman Portfolio award from Coe College in addition to the Best Freshman Writer and Best Senior Writer nods from Marquette University's Upward Bound Program.

My creative endeavors largely focus on poetry and contemporary romance. My self-published poetry collection, 30, was a featured campaign on Kickstarter's Art section. I have continued with a follow-up poetry collection, two novellas, and am nearing completion of my debut novel's first draft. All of my poetry work was published under Destiny Riley, while my romance work is available through a pen name.

From my education to my experience, I am interested in continuing my writing journey with opportunities in copywriting, editing, proofreading, scriptwriting, and ghostwriting. If you would like further demonstration of my capabilities, please email me at the address found on my resume. Thank you!
